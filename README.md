# Kirby Air Ride Checklist
This is a project to show my love for Kirby Air Ride by letting the community track and share thier achievements with a 1:1 recreation of the Checklist shown in-game, allowing for users to get collective data on achievement rarities and where they place in the world!

## DJUI Javascipt
This project features a fork of the djui-js library, made specifically for Air Ride's text rendering, to render everything you see on the website!
